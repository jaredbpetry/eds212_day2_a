Scatter plot of body mass versus flipper length 
```{r}
#----tell it that you are using ggplot, give dataset you will use, and give variables we will deal with (tell it what x and y are)
#----use exact name of variables in data set because R is case and spelling sensitive 
#----tell it that you want to give different colors for each species 

ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species), size=1)
```
